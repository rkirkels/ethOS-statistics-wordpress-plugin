# ethOS statistics plugin for WordPress
This plugin connects to your ethOS panel and retrieves all available data about your mining rigs.

After installation, a new widget is available that displays the data that is retrieved from your 
ethOS panel, like:

- Total hashrate of your mining farm  
- Details about all mining rigs in your farm, like:  
  - Hashrate
  - System uptime
  - Mining time
  - Amount of miners (GPU's)
  - Details of the rig's miners, like:  
    - Hashrate
    - Temperature
    
To prevent your website from slow loading, caching of the panel's data is enabled by default and 
is set to 1 minute. You can change the caching time to fit your need or disable the caching.
